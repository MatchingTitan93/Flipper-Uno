# Flipper-Uno
Just wanted to recreate the Flipper Zero (https://flipperzero.one/) on Arduino, obviously done worse because I'm not as good as them.

Check the [releases](https://github.com/MatchingTitan93/Flipper-Uno/releases) page to download the latest version.

## DISCLAIMER:
I do not want and do not claim in any way to discredit the work done by the folks at Flipper Zero. I don't want responsibility for any action done by anyone using the following codes, use anything ONLY on your own devices for fun or security testing, but never do it on others' devices without their explicit consent. 

This is a personal project, posted on GitHub to make it available to those who need it and especially to those who want to contribute to the project.
Please have mercy on me, I am not a programmer, but I try, so if you notice absurdities within the code do not discredit but try to help, thank you.

## What is this?
this is a project to try to recreate the functions of Flipper Zero on Arduino, or at least its basic functions. If you would like to contribute by making changes or testing it on your own and leaving feedback, feel free to do it! I would be incredibly pleased.

## What i plan to include (in order of importance)(if it's marked, i already done it):
- [x] Receive and send IR signals
- [ ] Store and read IR signals on an external SD for later usage
- [ ] Improve the menu
- [ ] Add a rechargable battery and a switch to turn it on and off
- [ ] Sub 1GHz signals
- [ ] WiFi signals
- [ ] Bluetooth
- [ ] NFC
- [ ] Other
